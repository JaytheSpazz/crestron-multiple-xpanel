# crestron-multiple-xpanel
This is the CMD file that allows you to run more than one Smart Graphics XPanel on your machine.

You MUST right click it and run it as Administrator otherwise it won't work. After running the script,
you can right click on any Smart Graphics VTZ touchpanel file or C3P xpanel file and you will see three
more options for opening the file: Instance 2, Instance 3, and Instance 4.
